      <h1>United States - Hearts of Iron IV</h1>

      <p>The United States is a major power in Hearts of Iron IV, with a vast industrial base and a large population. As the United States, players must balance the demands of a global war with domestic politics and economic development.</p>
      
      <h2>History</h2>
      
      <p>The United States entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Prior to that, the country had followed a policy of isolationism and neutrality, although it provided aid to the Allies in various forms. As the United States, players can choose to pursue a similar policy of neutrality, or join the Allies earlier and take a more active role in the war.</p>
      
      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      
      <p>The United States has a massive industrial base and access to a wide range of resources. The country also has a large navy and air force, allowing it to project power across the globe. In addition, the United States benefits from a stable political system and a diverse population.</p>
      
      <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
      
      <p>The United States' main weakness is its geographic isolation from the main theaters of war in Europe and Asia. The country must devote significant resources to building up its military and infrastructure in order to project power overseas. In addition, the United States may face political challenges at home, such as opposition to the war or demands for civil rights and social justice.</p>
      
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      
      <p>Playing as the United States requires a careful balance of military, economic, and political considerations. Players must decide when to enter the war, which theaters to focus on, and how to manage the country's massive industrial capacity. Some key strategies for playing as the United States include: building up the navy and air force, supporting the Allies through lend-lease and other means, and managing domestic politics to maintain public support for the war.</p>
